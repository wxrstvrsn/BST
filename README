# How to run tests

If you are a MIREA student and
you have access to the cathedral
server, then log in, upload the
following files to one folder

Compile an object file "BST.o" from your "BST.cpp" and "BST.h":
- g++ -c BST.cpp -o BST.o

Then we check that the test and the object are in the
same directory, and from it we make
- g++ BST.o -o test -L./ -lTEST

Then ./test
